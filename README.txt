AFQ version 1.2

==============================
Automated Fiber Quantification
==============================

AFQ was designed to generate Tract Profiles of tissue properties for major fiber tracts in healthy and diseased brains. Online documentation can be found at: 
https://github.com/yeatmanlab/AFQ/wiki.
We have now released pyAFQ and all current development is occuring on the Python version: https://github.com/yeatmanlab/pyAFQ
For help and updates on MATLAB join the AFQ mailing list in google groups:
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/automated-fiber-quantification-afq

AFQ has been tested for MATLAB r2009b through MATLAB r2021. It requires functions from the MATLAB stats toolbox, vistasoft and SPM.
